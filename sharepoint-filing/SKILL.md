description: |
  Navigate and file documents in Triptyq Capital's SharePoint structure. Use this skill whenever someone needs to save a document to SharePoint, find where a file should go, create a new deal folder, organize due diligence materials, or file investment memos, legal docs, meeting notes, or any work product in the right place. Triggers on "save to SharePoint", "file this", "put this in the deal folder", "where does this go", "create a folder for [company]", "organize these docs", or any reference to filing, archiving, or storing documents in the Triptyq shared drive. Also use when the investment-memo or vc-due-diligence skills produce output that needs to be filed.

## Deal Flow Convention

Every deal gets a numbered folder under `03_Occasions Invest/02_Deal Flow/`:

```
[###]_[Company Name]/
├── From Co/              ← Docs FROM the company (legal, cap tables, decks, data room)
├── From Triptyq/         ← Docs WE produce (memos, DD reports, analysis)
└── Internal/ (optional)  ← Deeper analysis
    ├── 01_Preliminary Analysis/
    └── 03_Deliverables/
        └── 01_Investment Memo/
```

### Naming: `[###]_[Company Name]` — sequential numbers, common name (not legal entity).
Examples: `110_Calder AI`, `100_VVD`, `74_QARL.AI`, `59_Anomaly`

## How to File

1. **Determine type** using the table above
2. **Search for existing folder**: `sharepoint_folder_search(name="[Company]")`
3. **If no folder exists**: find the highest number in Deal Flow, create next sequential `[###]_[Company]/` with `From Co/` and `From Triptyq/` subfolders
4. **Upload via Rube** using the OneDrive API with SharePoint drive_id (see Upload section below)

## Automated Upload via Rube.app

The Composio SharePoint connector has a tenant configuration issue (`invalid_resource`). The working approach uses the **OneDrive** connector with the SharePoint `drive_id` parameter:

**SharePoint Drive ID (Documents Triptyq library):**
`b!wPs8sWIq70Kt7RsL80wFKBqB2HWWzZdAnhoakfwfYIWRgc_-ZgmSTLpthkkQlSJu`

**Pipeline:**
1. Build or obtain the file in the Rube sandbox
2. Stage via `upload_local_file()` to get an `s3key`
3. Upload via `ONE_DRIVE_ONEDRIVE_UPLOAD_FILE` with:
   - `drive_id`: the SharePoint drive ID above
   - `folder`: the target path (e.g., `/03_Occasions Invest/02_Deal Flow/110_Calder AI/From Triptyq`)
   - `file`: `{ name, mimetype, s3key }`
   - `conflict_behavior`: `"replace"` to overwrite existing

**For PDF generation in the Rube sandbox:** Use `npm install puppeteer` + `pandoc` to convert docx → HTML → styled PDF with Triptyq branding.

**Example:**
```python
res, err = upload_local_file("/home/user/memo.docx")
s3key = res['s3key']
result, error = run_composio_tool('ONE_DRIVE_ONEDRIVE_UPLOAD_FILE', {
    'file': {'name': 'memo.docx', 'mimetype': 'application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.wordprocessingml.document', 's3key': s3key},
    'folder': '/03_Occasions Invest/02_Deal Flow/110_Calder AI/From Triptyq',
    'drive_id': 'b!wPs8sWIq70Kt7RsL80wFKBqB2HWWzZdAnhoakfwfYIWRgc_-ZgmSTLpthkkQlSJu',
    'conflict_behavior': 'replace'
})
```

## Creating a New Deal Folder

1. Search existing deal flow folders for the next available number
2. Create `03_Occasions Invest/02_Deal Flow/[###]_[Company Name]/`
3. Create `From Co/` and `From Triptyq/`
4. If diligence is starting, also create `Internal/01_Preliminary Analysis/`

## Rules

- **From Co vs From Triptyq**: Never mix. Company docs in `From Co/`, our work in `From Triptyq/`.
- **Numbering**: Always sequential, always check what exists first.
- **French months**: The meeting folders use French month names. Use them.
- **Don't restructure**: Follow existing conventions even if inconsistent. The team knows where things are.
- **File immediately**: When the investment-memo or vc-due-diligence skill produces output, offer to file it before ending.


## File Bridge: Cross-Sandbox Upload (April 2026)

When Claude generates a file locally (docx, pdf) and needs to upload it to SharePoint, use the **File Bridge** recipe (`rcp_dIhYYIkp46B3`).

### Workflow
1. **Claude commits** the file to `staging/` in the `triptyq-skills` repo:
   ```
   base64-encode the file → GITHUB_CREATE_OR_UPDATE_FILE_CONTENTS
   path: staging/<filename>
   ```
2. **Run the File Bridge recipe** with:
   - `github_path`: `staging/<filename>`
   - `sharepoint_folder`: target path (e.g., `/03_Occasions Invest/02_Deal Flow/110_Calder AI/From Triptyq`)
   - `filename`: display name for SharePoint
   - `mimetype`: file MIME type
3. Recipe handles: GitHub download → S3 staging → SharePoint upload → GitHub cleanup

### When to Use
- After generating investment memos, tearsheets, or any documents via docx-js
- After producing PDFs via LibreOffice conversion
- Any time a file exists on Claude's machine and needs to reach SharePoint

### File Size Limit
GitHub Content API supports files up to ~100MB. For larger files, use manual drag-and-drop.
